										<h2 class="major">Honda Enthusiast</h2>
										<p> For over 10 years, I have been an enthusiast of the Japanese car manufacturer Honda. I have owned and worked on dozens of Hondas across many models, and body styles. To this day I still own a Honda, and while I can't say exactly what got me into them, I can say I will always be a Honda owner and enthusiast.</p>

										<h2 class="major">PC Gaming</h2>
										<p>Video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, from the Nintendo Entertainment Console to the Playstation 4 and beyond. When I am not enjoying the outdoors with my family, much of my free time has been spent playing video games, or creating inside of video games. Fallout, Call of Duty, Unreal Tournament, Final Fantasy, I can't name enough games I have put hours and months into. As I grow older, I find less time for gaming, but I will always remember the experiences I have had playing some of the great masterpieces of the game developers around the world. </p>

										<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of my life, is family. My daughter to the right has been a great impact on my life to drive me towards success, and while I have met with a lot of failure in the process, I know with continued determination I will eventually achieve my goals to be a positive impact on her life. One thing in life I can say was a beautiful success, was the creation of new life.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Professional Skills</h2>
									<p>Throughout the years I have studied a wide range of talents and trade skills. I would like to say I am a jack-of-all-trades, however a few particular subjects with peek interests have captured me and I have progressed well into advanced proficiency within these skills. While I have gained some valuable knowledge, I still continue to learn new skills to this day. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Automotive Service and Repair</h3>
											<p>For over 10 years I have learned the inner workings of cars from the engine and transmission, to the drivetrain and suspension. Pass me a tool box, and I can do anything to a car with a mechanical or electrical problem!</p>

											<p>My latest adventure has been to study the aspects of Web Development, learning languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My end goal is to be successful in a career path as the tech industry is ever expanding and will always be high demand.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Computer Technology</h3>
											<p>Like working with cars, I share an equal fascination with building computers and working with computer hardware. I have built many computers for myself, business partners and friends alike. In addition to building them, I enjoy breaking them, pushing them to their limits and seeing what they can do.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Audiophile</h3>
											<p>Another fantastic interest of mine is High-Fidelity sound reproduction. Yes thats right, big speakers and big sound! More than just big speakers and big sound, Acoustics plays a MAJOR part in a good audio system. I build boxes tuned to frequencies best fit for small environments, like your car. Professional audio installation has been a hobby of mine and from unknown clients to friends and family I have installed dozens of custom built car audio systems. Feel the music!</p>
